    <p>Hello there. My name is Oliver Tragante. I was born in Brazil and currently live in the UK. I am majoring in Applied Technology</p>
    <p>I love to play the guitar, watch some good movies and go on a trip.<p>I am married and my wife is currently pregnant so we are very excited with our firstborn on it's way.</p>
     I work as a Software Developer for a Tech company. I had the chance to conclude a certificate at the Ensign College in Cyber Security but I  am always pursuing  
     more challanges and I believe BYU-Idaho can offer me a wider range of knowledge to delop my skills even more.</p>
    <p>As a Junior Developer I work as a CMS (Case Management System) developer, which consists of monitoring and assemenents of worfklow and database maitenance for 
    Law firms throughout the entire UK and Australia. I though it'd be beneficial to learn some more areas of coding and I found Applied Technology very beneficial</p>
    <p>I am happy and excited for this semester.</p>
